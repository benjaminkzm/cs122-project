Project Description

This project leverages the Steam API to analyze key aspects of gaming trends. It tracks player count trends for popular games, monitors price fluctuations to alert users about discounts, and provides insights into multiplayer matchmaking wait times and peak hours. This platform will present interactive visualizations and real-time data analysis to help gamers make informed decisions.
